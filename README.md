# 👋 Hey there, I'm Amisha!

I'm a second-year student pursuing a Masters in AI & Data Science at aivancity school, currently navigating life in Paris.

**What I'm up to:**
- 🎓 Learning the ropes of Machine Learning and building my skills in Python, SQL, and Data Visualization (Power BI, Matplotlib).
- 🤝 Currently deep in an **AI Clinic project** with **FPT Software**, collaborating with my team to build and deliver a real-world AI solution.
- 🚀 Previously, I interned @AMZIL AI and worked on a university automation project @Systra, building tools with FastAPI and React.
- 💡 I'm really passionate about **tech that serves a purpose**—my goal is to untangle complex problems and build towards a more sustainable future.

**Beyond the Code:**
When I'm not buried in code or data, you can find me playing badminton or exploring visual arts. I'm a firm believer in teamwork and love connecting with fellow developers and creators.

**Let's Connect!**
I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects or just having a chat about tech, sustainability, or badminton! 😄
